Simulations - LTSpice

These simulations are being used to determine how certain components are being used in the REV_E 
system. I (Cameron) have little knowledge of how this all works; to understand better, I'm going
to perform some simulations in LTSpice to see how each component is working. From there, my models
can be built on to determine how to better provide circuit options for the design team.
